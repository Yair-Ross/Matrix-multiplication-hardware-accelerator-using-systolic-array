PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Matrix Multiplication Hardware Accelerator is designed multiply matrices faster and more efficiently than the CPU. It is designed to communicate with a CPU using AMBA4 protocol. The project was developed using Verilog and System Verilog and demonstrated the design and verification parts of ASIC design.
