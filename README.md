# Matrix-Multiplication-Hardware-Accelarator-Using-Systolic-Array
## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Matrix Multiplication Hardware Accelerator is designed multiply matrices faster and more efficiently than the CPU. It is designed to communicate with a CPU using AMBA4 protocol. The project was developed using Verilog and System Verilog and demonstrated the design and verification parts of ASIC design.

## FEATURES
- multiply and add effitiently matrices
- support matrices of dimentions from 1x1 to 4x4 (can also be non ssquare matrices)
- configurable parameter size: BUS_WITH, ADRESS_WIDTH, DATA_WIDTH, SP_NTARGETS(ammount of matrices stored in sp memory)
- can be connected and controlled from a AMBA bus
